/* Raw ROM output bypasses stdio entirely, so neither wendy_stdio (which owns the
 * /dev/console VFS) nor wendy_com (which hooks esp_log_set_vprintf) can capture
 * or redirect it. When it lands on USB Serial/JTAG it collides with wendy_usj,
 * which owns that peripheral, and the two streams interleave mid-line. The
 * esp32-camera driver is the main source: it uses ets_printf for its DMA-path
 * warnings ("cam_hal: FB-OVF") because those run where blocking on stdio is
 * unsafe.
 *
 * The ROM's uart_tx_one_char() has *two* independent routes to USB, so both have
 * to be closed:
 *
 *   a4 = ets_get_printf_channel()
 *   if (g_usb_print) { tx(4, c); if (a4 == 4) return; }   // 4 = USB Serial/JTAG
 *   if (g_uart_print)  tx(a4, c);
 *
 * 1. g_usb_print is a ROM flag that unconditionally mirrors every char to USB.
 *    IDF sets it (and g_uart_print) to true in esp_rom_install_uart_printf() as
 *    a workaround for chips where ROM logging was disabled via eFuse, so it is
 *    on regardless of CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_*. This is the route that was actually
 *    active here. Clearing it leaves g_uart_print alone, so ROM output still
 *    reaches the selected channel.
 *
 * 2. That selected channel can itself be USB. With CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART_DEFAULT
 *    the bootloader never calls esp_rom_output_set_as_console() -- that call is
 *    inside #if CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART_CUSTOM -- so the channel keeps whatever
 *    the ROM picked when the chip booted over USB. It measured 0 (UART0) on this
 *    board, but forcing it costs nothing and covers the case where it is not.
 *
 * This also covers the panic handler and early-boot logs, which share the same
 * ROM channel. g_usb_print is a raw ROM symbol, PROVIDEd by esp32s3.rom.ld
 * rather than declared in any header -- hence the externs below.
 *
 * The C2 and C3 ROMs expose the same pair of flags and take the same patched
 * esp_rom_install_uart_printf() path, so the guard above can be widened if this
 * ever targets one of those.
